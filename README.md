# Flickopia Waitlist

A simple, functional landing page for a pre-registration waitlist.  
Users can leave their email to join the waitlist, and the data is collected through Netlify Forms.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a compact, working demo, not a full product. It‚Äôs designed to show a functional, live feature rather than a polished platform.

## üîó Live Demo
[https://flickopia.netlify.app/](https://flickopia.netlify.app/)

## üõ† Under the Hood
- Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**  
- **Netlify Forms** for email collection with a honeypot for basic spam protection  
- Client-side email validation including format and common provider checks  
- Minimal JS handles **notifications, FAQ toggle, and slider animations**  

This project demonstrates the ability to take an idea and turn it into a **working, user-friendly page**. While small in scope, it‚Äôs reliable, responsive, and practical : a neat showcase of functional front-end development.

## Notes
- The project is intentionally simple: fast to load, accessible, and focused on delivering its core feature  
- It‚Äôs meant as a **demonstration of capability** rather than a full-scale product  
- Works well as a reference for clients or freelance opportunities
